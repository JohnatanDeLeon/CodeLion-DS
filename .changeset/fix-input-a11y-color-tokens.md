- Fix: remove redundant `role="textbox"` from `Input` component to resolve an `aria-allowed-role` violation reported by the Storybook a11y runner.
- Fix: adjust primary color token (`primary.600`) and primary gradient stop from `#0284c7` to a darker `#0369a1` to improve color contrast.

These changes are focused on accessibility improvements and do not introduce breaking API changes.
